## What every critic must return (operator S405: "i want the critics everytime to state what to change to reach 10/10")
Whatever you score (a screen, a film, a mechanic, a design), end with **To reach 10/10**: the concrete changes that would take it from your score to 10, most important first, each specific enough to build. If it needs something the game cannot do yet, say so. A score without this list is not finished.

## What every critic must return (operator S405: "i want the critics everytime to state what to change to reach 10/10")
Whatever you score (a screen, a film, a mechanic, a design), end with **To reach 10/10**: the concrete changes that would take it from your score to 10, most important first, each specific enough to build.

# FightCamp critic pack: the whole game, for judging whether a screen has the right options

Owner's rule: "i want every screen you design to have the right options so every critic needs to know the whole game design and mechanics to guide you".
This pack is facts only: no scores, no verdicts, no earlier critic comments, and nothing that is merely proposed. Written 2026-11-08 from the code
and the agreed plans. Where a document and the code disagree, the pack says what the code does.

How to read the status tags:
- BUILT = it is in the game now and a player can use it.
- AGREED, NOT BUILT = the owner approved it (or a plan he approved includes it) but the game does not do it yet. Judge a screen as if it will exist.
- PARTLY = some of it is in the game; the pack says which part.
- NOT ESTABLISHED = the pack could not confirm it from the code or the plans. Do not assume either way.
Names only in headers (owner S448: "notice how the names are only mentioned on the header , nowhere in text menus options , follow that rule"): a person's name sits in the screen's header once; options, buttons, rows, lines and tooltips say her / him / the opponent / your coach. Flag every name you see outside a header.
A screen should offer an option only if the player can act on it (rule in section 7). "Option" below means anything the player can press, drag, pick or type.

## 1. What the game is

- A boxing gym management game for PC (Godot 4.7, Windows). The player is the head coach and owner of one small boxing club. Not a promoter, not a fighter,
  not a tycoon. The club lives on members who pay monthly dues; a fighter's bouts add ticket cuts, reputation and new members.
- Scope for the first release: boxing and no-gi BJJ (the owner decided BJJ ships beside boxing). MMA comes in the first update after launch. Kickboxing and
  Muay Thai are not scheduled. Early Access is the target; no date.
- The player controls: whom to sign and which starting focus; the coaches and staff hired; the week of training for each fighter (mornings, pad and sparring
  evenings, diet); which bouts to take or ask for; the camp before a bout; the game plan written as lines; combinations built and drilled; the corner calls
  and corner minute on fight night; the fighter's next goal; the club's money (dues, spending, deals, upgrades).
- The player does NOT control: the punches thrown. The fight is settled by rules (exchanges of 30 seconds); the 3D fight only shows the settled round and
  never decides. The player also does not control fighters' moods directly, rival fighters, the weather/twist cards, injuries, or when offers arrive.
- The fun, in the owner's and the design's words: raising an unknown into a champion; the plan is the star; you can always see how your plan made the
  difference (the Why after every fight); every week costs something (training, weight, fatigue and money pull against each other); fighters are people
  (traits, habits, moods); fast and honest (anything one click from anywhere, true numbers). The three core mechanics beside the corner (owner S354):
  the morning sessions that add up to a goal and an intensity (the week), the evening move and combination planner, and a fight plan that is fun to design.
  The Playbook/Combos area is the part the owner calls really fun ("to try and also learn from the book").
- Design rule on results: the better-trained fighter usually wins; a good plan turns close fights and gives underdogs a real chance. Measured in tests:
  good plan about 59% of bouts, no plan 45%, bad plan 41% (one matchup). Training beats planning: 5 points better in stats wins about 72%, 10 points about 95%.
- Not mobile, not casual: no timers, gacha, daily rewards or ads. Real stats stay visible. Deeper, not wider (owner approved "build all proposed systems").
- Tone: a gym, warm and tactile, not a spreadsheet. Plain words, one word per concept, no flavour text.

## 2. A career from the first minute to the first pro fight

Time model: the clock runs day by day when the player presses the big CONTINUE button. It stops by itself every Monday (the week review) and for
anything that needs the player (a bout offer on its last day, weigh-in, fight night, injury choice, trial day, walk-in). Day 0 is Monday 5 January 2026.
The button says what it is stopping for ("to Thu 15 Jan, the offer expires"). Quiet week = one click.

1. Title screen: Resume career (if a save exists), New career, Quick start (a ready club, London), Load career, Settings, Credits, Quit.
2. New career, two steps. Step 1 YOU: your name and one of four head coaches on photo cards (Old hand, Ex-pro, Amateur coach, Strength coach), each with one
   edge. Step 2 YOUR CLUB: country, city, gym name, and one of three starts that double as difficulty: Fresh doors (normal), In debt with one good boxer (hard),
   Backed with big expectations (risky). A switch lets the player skip the first-hour guide. Quick start takes the first coach card and Fresh doors.
3. Day 0, Home: the first-hour card (the job: keep the doors open; the first show date; who you are), a walk-in fighter waiting at reception (Lucy Jackson in
   the standard start; other starts and the male-boxer start use other names). The guide strip runs three stages: FIRST WEEK (sign, coach, week, go),
   FIRST FIGHT (offer, prep, fight), THE CLUB (second boxer, bouts for both, set the first boxer's next goal). It can be skipped.
4. Sign the walk-in: an RPG-style card (class from style, potential in stars, each attribute's ceiling, two traits, one habit, a signature move, an
   ambition) and ONE starting focus. Hire an assistant coach (Luke Reid sessional $450 a week, or Marcus Hale full-time $1,090 a week; $1,000 signing fee).
   Without any coach, training runs at 60%. Open the Week and lock in week 1 (the coach has already written a week). Press CONTINUE.
5. Monday of week 2 (day 7): the first bout offer arrives, for the club show on Saturday of week 4 (day 26). Until the first bout is fought there is no twist
   card and no ask. She starts about 1.4 kg over the limit, so weight is the first real decision (a cut needs starting in week 1). Accept shows a poster
   reveal and offers the camp.
6. Fight prep: camp (focus, intensity, partner, film), game plan, weigh-in the day before, fight night, result, Why, goal talk. After the first bout: a second
   walk-in arrives the next Monday, a rival coach (Frank Doyle, Eastside ABC) is named in the news, three club tasks appear on the guide strip, and Ana (the
   no-gi athlete) is teased, then asks to join after the club's second bout or by week 9.
7. The loop afterwards: offers every couple of weeks (a club show every other Saturday from day 12), camps, nationals, money pressure, more fighters.
8. Amateur road: the National Amateur Championships. Entry needs 5 bouts and 3 months registered, age 19-40; entries close in week 10; a London regional then a
   national draw. While in it, no other offers come. A loss, injury or missed weight ends the run.
9. Turning pro: a promoter's offer arrives at 7 wins with a top-3 regional rank, or at 9 wins at any rank. The debut is 4 rounds, about 4 weeks after signing.
   The gym pays the licence ($230) and, the first time, medicals ($875) and the trainer's licence ($140). Stipend stops. After the debut a pro joins a world
   division table unranked and the promoter brings three offers per fight (see 4.12). Older docs said "the game ends near the first pro fights"; the code
   goes further (pro ladder, belts, ageing, retirement), see section 8.
10. The club failing: 8 weeks in a row below $0 closes the gym. A closed gym shows a summary that cannot be dismissed (New career / Load career / Title).

## 3. The fighter: three layers

Plan agreed by the owner (2026-11-08): a fighter has primary attributes (what the fighter IS, same in every sport), skills (how good at one sport) and moves
(a jab, a low kick, an armbar; each has its own level in the Playbook: New, Raw, Usable at 30, Sharp at 60, Signature at 85).

AGREED, NOT BUILT: the 10 primary attributes. Operator: "these 10 lookok"; one Speed for hands and feet (the game's Hand speed becomes Speed). Strength; Explosiveness; Speed;
Stamina; Recovery; Flexibility; Durability; Fight IQ; Composure; Heart. One Strength number for the whole body (no number per hand; left/right differ through
moves and stance). Merges: Chin and Toughness become Durability; boxing Conditioning and BJJ Cardio become Stamina. Power is not its own number (it comes from
Strength, Explosiveness and skill). Weight cut, height, reach and stance are written facts, not bars. "Marks easily" is a label for cuts, not a bar. Aggression is
a slider you set (Patient to Forward), not a bar. Technique and Defence become skills. Explosiveness and Recovery stay only if the fight really uses them.
AGREED, NOT BUILT: 12 skills (ops/research/S400_REVIEW/SKILLS_PROPOSAL_S404.md). Boxing 5: Accuracy, Timing, Defence, Footwork, Inside fighting. Kickboxing and Muay Thai 6: those + Clinch. No-gi BJJ 5: Takedowns, Guard, Top game, Submissions, Escapes. MMA 12 in three groups. The profile design (one body and mind for every sport; only skills swap; a sport switch appears only once the
fighter trains both; crossing over costs training time) is agreed in shape; the mockup number lists (24 numbers, 25 for a boxer) predate the 10-attribute list.

BUILT today (what screens show):
- Boxing: 7 trained stats: Power, Hand speed, Technique, Defence, Conditioning, Ring IQ (fight IQ), Chin; plus Footwork (derived from speed and defence) and
  the personality values Heart, Discipline, Confidence, Coachability, Temper (Loyalty exists but is not on the board). Amateur women's lightweights sit 55-65;
  bands: weak under 45, fair under 55, solid under 65, strong under 75, elite above. Each stat has a potential ceiling ("tick") and a weekly delta.
- Moves with mastery (0-100): Jab, Cross, Lead hook, Body hook, Uppercut, Check hook; from 30 a move is a "weapon" the fight can use. Combinations (the
  book: 1-1, 1-2, 1-1-2, 2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3-2, 3b-3, 1-2-3b, 1-6-3, slip 2-3) unlock when their moves are weapons; players can also build their own.
- Body: weight vs class limit, condition (fatigue word), injuries. Style word (Out-boxer, Pressure fighter, Counter-puncher, Volume puncher, Boxer-puncher,
  Slugger). Stance. Age. Record. Rank in the region.
- Personality and habits, learned not shown as numbers in the ring: 6 traits (heart, temper, confidence, discipline, coachability, loyalty) and habits
  (for example drops the right after the jab, slow starter, fades late, chases stoppage). A coach's-notes card fills in with words from fights and sparring.
- Morale (stored 0-100): Fired up (75+), Steady (50+), Flat (30+), Low. Moves: win +8, loss -12, goal met/missed, rest week +4, a month without a fight -6,
  bout booked +5, wrong corner call -2, right call +1. Morale is also trust in the corner: Fired up 1.05, Steady 1.0, Flat 0.85, Low 0.7 of the corner's
  word taken in; a Low fighter stops listening.
- BJJ athletes have 6 stats (strength, cardio, flexibility, explosiveness, composure, aggression) and mastery per move; belts, not ranks.
- Perks (the perk road): open for good when attributes reach a need, each changes one thing in a bout: Iron chin (Chin 70), Stiff jab (Technique 65),
  Second wind (Conditioning 70), Ring general (Ring IQ 65, corner calls work 25% better), Counter sense (Defence 65 + Check hook weapon), Body snatcher (Body
  hook weapon), Finisher (Power 70), Fast hands (Hand speed 70).

## 4. Every mechanic

### 4.1 The week and training plan - BUILT
- Choice: for each fighter a week of seven mornings (a session each: roadwork, intervals, heavy bag, weights, speed bag, slip rope, shadow, neck work, or rest;
  each at Light, Normal or Hard) and seven evenings (Pads, Sparring, Rest, Film). The coach writes the week from the camp phase and repeats it; the player edits
  exceptions (click a day, a popover). "Back to the coach's week" resets. Diet: Hold or Cut 500 kcal a day.
- Phases counted back from a booked bout: BASE (no bout), BUILD (3+ weeks out), PEAK (2 weeks out, hardest, sparring twice), TAPER (fight week: light, three rest
  days, no sparring).
- Changes: each morning adds a small amount to one stat (pace 1.0 per focused week x coach factor x headroom clamp((potential-stat)/25, 0.10, 1.25), a morning
  is a fifth of it, Light x0.6, Hard x1.3, less when tired); kcal and weight; fatigue (0-100, "Week tiredness"; from 80 she is overreached: gains x0.6 and
  injury risk x3). The Week tab shows plan totals, the goal line, the coach's one change with a "Do it" button, and the weeks to fight night.
- Coach factor: 0.5 + rating x 0.7 per cent; no coach = 60%. Strength coach head-coach edge: body mornings +10%, craft mornings -10%.
- Twist card: once a week the coach draws one (sore wrist, rain, weights room shut, partner ill, head cold, visiting pro, quiet week; or a choice card such as
  tight knee, scale will not move, night off, heating breaks, combo clicking, southpaw in town, old coach visits, sponsor photoshoot, rival talks trash). Two
  answers each with a visible price; unanswered = the coach's pick on Monday. Planned vs actual is shown on the review.
- Training load: acute vs usual load; a spike (ratio 1.5+) raises injury risk 2-4x.
- Two fighters in camp competing for the coach's pad nights: AGREED, NOT BUILT (see 4.2).

### 4.2 Pads, combinations and mastery - BUILT (pad nights for two fighters AGREED, NOT BUILT)
- Evenings are nights that carry drill cards. A pad night is 75 minutes split over its cards; a sparring night gives every card already in her hands a share.
  Standard week: 3 pad nights; camp 2+1 / 2+2 / 3+2 pad+spar for Light/Standard/Hard.
- Choice: drag a drill card (a move or combination) onto a pad night; split a night 50/50, 70/30, 30/70; remove or clear; pin cards in the tray; "+ drill it".
- Mastery gain per hour of drilling: pads 2.1, heavy bag 1.05, shadow 0.85, sparring 1.5, speed bag 0.9, double-end bag 1.2. Undrilled moves fade slowly.
  A drilled combination also holds its punches. Tiers: New, Raw (under 30), Usable (30), Sharp (60), Signature (85). A move at 30+ is a weapon.
  Today a planned line fires every time once it is usable; sharp is worth about 1 win in 100 over usable. In the game but SWITCHED OFF (S427,
  measured on 400 bouts a cell): a planned line fires 1 use in 2 at usable, 3 in 4 at sharp, always at Signature (sharp then +2.8 wins in 100
  over usable, Signature +2.7 over sharp). Also measured and NOT in the game: an opponent's corner waiting for your best line (costs 7 wins
  in 100, no answer wins back more than 3.7).
- A combination in a fight costs energy (longer costs more); a flurry is limited by hand speed and tiredness; a signature (drilling, not length) may run one
  punch past the speed cap. Own combinations built in the Playbook (Combos tab) get their own pad mastery.
- AGREED, NOT BUILT: with two fighters in camp the coach's pad nights are shared; the top row of "Learn on the pads" shows how many go to each (cost to the
  other fighter), only while two are in camp; a needs flag says when the second camp starts.

### 4.3 Fight camp - BUILT
- Opened by "Set camp" (a need once a bout is 3+ weeks off, or from Fight prep). Choices: camp focus (one of Conditioning, Power, Technique, Defence, Speed);
  intensity Light / Standard / Hard (3, 4, 5 nights; focus multiplier 1.1/1.2/1.35; fight-night edge +0.25/+0.6/+1.0; all free); Partner: club mates (free) or an
  outside mate of the opponent's stance or style ($160); Film (tape study, free).
- Changes: the camp stat gets a forecast to fight night; scale forecast; tape study opens one tell on the opponent's file every few camp days (weapon first,
  weakness last). A camp whose three lines are all met on fight night (made weight, stat on target, never overreached) gives PEAK CAMP: +bonus to every stat for
  that fight. A southpaw partner removes a round-1 penalty for an orthodox boxer who never faced one.

### 4.4 Weight - BUILT
- Each fighter has a class limit (women's 57/60/65/75 kg, men's 57.5/60/70/75 kg). Weigh-in is the day before. Diet Hold/Cut and training burn move weight;
  the bout page and Fight prep forecast "now / on the day". Missing weight calls the bout off and the club pays $300 for the empty slot. A boxer over his
  class can get a bout he can make (a later date). The Old hand head coach makes cuts easier (120 kcal a day more).

### 4.5 Booking and matchmaking - PARTLY
- Amateurs BUILT: offers arrive (a club show every other Saturday; one offer at a time per fighter, answer by a date, usually 8-12 weeks lead at clubs, 2-4
  weeks in the first hour). Each offer: Accept or Pass, both free. An unsafe mismatch (a novice, 0-10 bouts, against an open fighter) cannot be accepted. Win chance
  shown as a band that widens when unscouted. No way to ask for a named amateur opponent: AGREED; rules built (scripts/rules/AskBout.gd), panel not built (Ask for a fight: a "no" is a closed panel or an absent answer with its reason, never a random refusal).
- Pros BUILT (after the debut, on Fights): the promoter brings three offers per fight (TUNE-UP likely, STEP UP about even, PAYDAY long shot) standing 7 days; OR the
  player asks for a named boxer within the promoter's band (about 5 places above, unranked reach 15; a top-5 name needs 3 fans); Scout costs $250 and opens the
  opponent's weapon and weakness and narrows the chance range. A promoter refuses if you duck the step up twice. Each row shows chance, what a win gives (place,
  fans), what a loss costs, stoppage risk, pay (gym's 25% of the purse), and the gap to the next fight (quick, normal, hard night).
- Rank rule: beat someone above you and take their place; beat someone below and nothing moves; a losing record is never ranked in the top 10. Purse: $1,500 unranked
  + $400 per place; tickets follow fans and how close the fight looks. Pro rounds: 4 unranked, 6 ranked, 8 top 10, 10 for a title.

### 4.6 Scouting and the opponent's file - BUILT
- Free at booking: record, look, style word. Hidden until found: best weapon, each habit, weakness. Amateur: tape study in camp opens one a session. Pro: scout
  for $250; the weapon is public tape. A found tell names its answer (a plan situation, a corner call or a drill). The Ex-pro head coach opens one tell the day
  a bout is booked. An opponent with no bouts has no tape. The Tape Room (Fight prep, "Watch the tape") plays 3-4 films of her past bouts, SPOT the tell, then
  YOUR ANSWER picks a move that becomes a plan line.

### 4.7 The game plan (Playbook) - BUILT
- A plan is lines: "At long range -> One-two", "When she presses -> Step back" (places: outside, long, mid, inside, clinch, ropes; situations: she presses, boxes at range,
  waits to counter, loads up, tires). Each answer is rated vs the opponent's game: Beats it / Works / Walks into it, and its edge over improvising, times her pad
  time. Rate against another kind of opponent; round-by-round pace Push/Steady/Save; a go-to combination. The coach's skill sets how many lines (a plan holds
  4-6). Real fight plans can be loaded; See the flow; Open the map. With no plan written the assistant coach writes one (poor to about half of a read plan).
- A plan the fighter has not drilled works less well; a wrong answer costs. During a bout: planned right answers that win exchanges build PRESSURE on the opponent
  (cuts her output); planned wrong answers she is punished for shrink her energy ceiling.
- AGREED, NOT BUILT: opponents adjust by round 2; their note replaces the coach's line in the corner minute naming the line that stopped working.

### 4.8 Fight night - BUILT
- A bout is 3 rounds of 3 minutes (amateur), 4 (pro debut), more later. A round is six 30-second exchanges, each settled by dice on an edge (training, plan, corner call,
  pressure, tiredness). The opponent fights one way at a time (Pressing, Boxing at range, Waiting to counter, Loading up, Tiring, Hurt), shown as a clue.
- Every 30 seconds the player may shout one of the 3 calls that fit, or say nothing: Jab and move, Go to the body, Draw the lead, Hands up move your head, Let your
  hands go, Breathe pick your shots, Tie up, Go for the finish. Each has a best / ok / wrong match to the opponent's mode, needs stats, costs or gives energy; only
  two instructions per minute get through fully. Pace (Push / Steady / Save) and Aim (Own game / Head / Body / ribs / the hurt head) persist from shout to shout.
  A set-up "NOW!" fires a learned combination into a gap the opponent opens: big edge, or a cost if wrong.
- Corner minute between rounds: the corner card (what worked, what hurt, the call), the plan call, ONE CHANGE for the next round (a habit fix, or Elbows in: half the body punches go to the head, saving their energy and adding head damage, or Gloves high: the reverse; moved punches change where she is hit and what it costs, measured not to change who wins), RECOVER with 3 points (water, ice on the ribs, clear
  her head when hurt), SET-UP (a combination x a gap), TALK (calm / fire up / the truth), change one plan arrow, cutman job (close the cut, enswell an eye, nothing).
  Trust: a wrong call she followed costs trust; a Low fighter ignores shouting.
- Knockdowns and counts come from power and damage vs chin, heart for the count; amateur RSC at 3 counts in a round or 4 in a bout. Injury roll after the bout.
- Result: scorecards (3 judges), win on points / stoppage / draw, "what decided it", the Why, a body report (which part went first, with a "Train X next week"
  button), "The plan, lit up" flow, then Back home and the goal talk. Watch modes: with a picture the 3D fight plays (1x/2x, Skip round, Skip bout); headless runs
  stay in words. "Sim to result" skips the fight. Highlights/full modes in design notes: NOT ESTABLISHED as options in the UI.
- AGREED, NOT BUILT: a cutman card for a closing eye, "stop it (she loses, the eye is safe) or go on (risk of a lasting cut)", behind a divider, never a pop-up,
  never pre-selected, not using one of the two fixes (the 3D corner has a cutman job row today; whether its stop-or-go choice exists is NOT ESTABLISHED).

### 4.9 The Why - BUILT (the hook)
- After a bout, plain lines: YOUR PLAN (graded against having no plan: right answers, wrong answers, neutral, worth about +X% chance), AGAINST YOU (what the opponent's
  habits cost), NEXT (what to train or write). Graded by how each planned move answered what the opponent was doing, not by the dice; "swing" counts replay the
  dice without the plan's edge. A readable reason for every random swing (R11): AGREED, NOT BUILT as a general feature; it lives on existing rows.

### 4.10 Damage, injuries, suspension - BUILT
- Six body places per boxer take punches (head, ribs, etc.); bands fine over 55, hurt 55, critical 35, doctor 15. Bout injury roll from settled damage (about 6% a
  3x3 bout; 72% head/neck, 20% cuts); training injury about 1.3% a week, more when overreached. Stoppage loss = 30-day suspension, longer for repeats. While out: no
  offers, a quarter of gains. A fighter hurt before a bout: choice "pull out" (club pays the empty slot) or "fight hurt" (less energy: minor 10, moderate 15, serious 20).
  A damage ledger and fights-left forecast exist for pros in the world model.

### 4.11 Morale, trust, goals - BUILT
- Goals with deadlines (for example Debut inside a month, Next bout inside a month, Southpaw answer, Five-round engine), set in the office after each bout (Goal talk:
  pick one of the offered goals). Status ON TRACK / AT RISK / OFF TRACK / MET / MISSED; ~70% clearable by design; meeting or missing moves morale. "Her asks" can be
  heard or overruled (morale +5 / -5). The ambition shown on the signing card does not yet change anything (the design says a kept goal should build loyalty, a broken one may make a fighter leave: AGREED, NOT BUILT). Overruling a low-coachability fighter hurts more.

### 4.12 Staff - PARTLY
- Head coach (you): one of four edges: Old hand (cuts easier), Ex-pro (one tell on file when a bout is booked), Amateur coach (a prospect's exact potential), Strength
  coach (+10% body mornings, -10% craft mornings). Assistants: Luke Reid and Marcus Hale (above); training quality, plan lines taught (more with better rating), evening
  classes +$350 a week. Staff jobs on the Club page (each changes one number): Second club coach 10 h ($280 a week: +1 roster place, +40 members, runs fitness classes);
  Strength and conditioning ($100: training injury risk -15%, a pro camp's bill halved); Physio ($75: injuries back a quarter sooner); Cutman ($150 a pro night: half
  the post-bout layoffs). Letting a staff member go costs a week's pay. Letting the main assistant coach go: NOT ESTABLISHED (Let go exists on the staff jobs).
- "Coach runs it / I run it" per fighter: AGREED, NOT BUILT (the Roster has no such column).

### 4.13 Money and the gym - BUILT
- The week review gives one short reason beside any change in members (word getting round, gym full, less room, dues too steep, more than the gym's name can hold).
- Income each week: members' dues ($35 a month each standard; bands Cheap $25 / Standard $35 / Premium $45 change who joins), evening classes (+$350 with a coach), no-gi
  dues, sponsors, fitness classes, juniors' dues. Costs: rent $1,800 a month (bigger premises more), England-Boxing-style fees ($315 club + $18 a boxer + $35 a coach a year),
  coach, fighter stipends ($250 a week, optional), heating and power by season, insurance $1,250 a year, staff, kit budget (Low $0 / Standard $45 / Good $80 a week),
  upgrades' upkeep. Wages and upkeep are billed every 28 days. Start cash = 1 / 3 / 6 months of costs by start. Runway under 8 weeks warns; below $0 is red; 8 weeks in a
  row below $0 closes the gym. A loan ($180 a week for 26 weeks) comes with the debt start; the backed start loses $5,000 if the first show is lost. An overdraft rule
  exists (offered after 12 weeks of trading, 16% a year) but NOT ESTABLISHED as having a screen.
- One-offs: a bout adds a $450 ticket cut; camps cost a partner fee when used; repairs; a club show you host ($3,500, tickets $25, up to 400 seats, every 16 weeks, can lose
  money); a club grant bid once a year (answer in 42 days, needs a second coach, odds follow reputation).
- Spending choices on the Money page: Premises (Unit 70 members/3 places, $1,800 rent; Bigger unit 140/5, $3,400, $12,000 to move; Club building 250/7, $5,500, $25,000);
  Upgrades (matted floor $2,400; strength corner $3,600; fitness class kit $1,500; youth section $1,800), each bought once, works after a week, one visible effect; Sponsors
  (Ironclad $250/week from the start; Bow Road Physio $150 after the first win; bigger sponsors later); dues band; kit budget; evening coaches; pro stipends and contract talks.
- Members: walk toward a target set by reputation, dues band, premises and coaches (at most 6 a week). A win adds +8 members and +5 reputation; a loss removes 1 and 2 reputation;
  a stoppage loss 2 and 4. Facilities (floor, ring, bags, lockers, office) can be repaired once ($120 bags) for +2 reputation.
- A pro's share to the gym starts at 25% (manager 15% + trainer 10%); contract talks at the first top-10 and the first belt (keep 25% for a bonus or drop the share), then yearly.

### 4.14 Rankings, titles, the world - PARTLY
- Amateur regional table (the region's club-show boxers; a player's fighter enters at 4 wins); rankings move as rivals fight each other at shows; news lines. Nationals and the
  regional bracket (BUILT). World pro tables for four divisions (women's and men's lightweight and welterweight, about 20 ranked each): boxers age, peak, decline and retire
  (damage ledger and age), new ones arrive yearly, belts at four levels (area, national, continental, world) with mandatory challengers and vacated belts, rivals improve (BUILT in the
  rules; its screens are on Fights, not World). An open-ended career, year review, three club goals a year, club tiers, a record book of champions and rivalries,
  a named rival gym that poaches and rematches, promises/poaching at contract time, a career clock with retirement talk, youth-section home-grown prospects, a commentary line
  and a press card are AGREED (owner "all of them", Q-S294-120) and mostly NOT BUILT; Records (the gym's own history log with filters) and the youth section exist.

### 4.15 BJJ (no-gi) - BUILT
- Athletes (Ana Ribeiro) are on the mat, not in the ring: belts white, blue, purple, brown, black with 4 stripes each (IBJJF floor: blue needs 2 years, purple 1.5, brown 1; minimum
  ages 16/16/18/19). The week is 3 classes; a class drills the syllabus move she is closest to owning (+3.2 a week; owned at 30, signature 50). Choices: drill a move; stripe call
  (now / hold / early) with morale and loyalty costs; promote; enter opens (no-gi tournaments every 35 days, 8-person brackets); fight an open yourself (the player calls the moves on the move
  graph) or simulate it; who teaches (hired coach or the athlete). No ranking table: the belt is the ladder. 5-10 minute matches by belt; points: takedown 2, sweep 2, pass 3, knee on belly 2,
  mount 4, back 4. A BJJ athlete costs a roster place and a no-gi coach by the class.
- The match runs on two-sided beats of about 11 seconds (S405): each side either acts on its pick or works its grips, and a holding lead can draw the referee's 20-second stall count.
  Measured over 1,000 bouts: white belts finish about 34% of matches, the first to score keeps the bout about 80% of the time, and a one-belt gap wins about 74%.

### 4.16 Perks - BUILT (listed in section 3).

## 6. The seven approved menus, and the agreed structure of all menus

Owner, Q-S294-127: "Yes, build the seven": Home, Fighter Week, Boxing profile, Playbook, Fight night, Money, World. A shared warm-wall kit (WarmKit: wall, whiteboard, paper, sticky, magnet, chalkboard, marker
ledge) is built first so screens cannot drift. None of the seven is rebuilt in the kit yet; the screens in section 5 are the current ones. Agreed structure: five rail buttons (Home, Fighters, Fights, Club, World); one
home per job; no mailbox (Mail opens World News and the Monday page replaces the week-review pop-up); nothing opens by itself; time is one big button saying what it stops for; one booked fight runs in a straight line
(Home countdown, camp, weigh-in, tape, fight night, the Why).

- Home (agreed): needs first, the job, the next fight, one row per fighter, Since last Monday with causes, the club's week, what is coming; the week review folds in as a need that "sits here, never pops up"; the line
  under the big button names the next stop; the first-week guide card only in the first hour.
- Fighter Week (agreed): the whiteboard: sessions as magnets, the fight date circled, colour only means risk, one red button moves the week on; plan totals, fatigue, the goal line, the coach's one change with the effect on the
  button; Learn on the pads; ADD "Coach's pad nights" as the top row, two fighters in camp only, with the cost to the other fighter (R55).
- Boxing profile (agreed in shape; numbers superseded by the 10 attributes in section 3): tabs Overview, Week, Playbook, History on one portrait header; three columns Body, Skills, Mind with a style line ("Keeps it
  long"), one thing to work on and where it is trained; the sport switch only once she trains both; a rival gym's offer with its three answers (match it, promise something, let her go) as the top card when it
  comes (R58, needs the running world).
- Playbook (agreed): Moves (Escapes folded in), Game plan (lines drawn on a board, plays a default at once, rate against each kind of opponent), Combos; "No bout booked: try the plan against each kind of opponent".
- Fight night (agreed): dark and tight, handwritten coach notes, three fixes / time for two; stats cut to three rows in the minute; the "she has adapted" note (14 words at most) replaces the coach's note (R25); a
  cutman card only when an eye is closing (R28); the result with scorecards and the Why (plan, against you, next); the money lines move from the Why to Home; no "one change for next time" (the Why's NEXT carries it).
- Money (agreed): the gym's books on the whiteboard: cash, runway, in and out, bills, deals, repairs, upgrades; dues bands wait for the owner's call on the cut.
- World (agreed): News cut to only what touches you; Rankings with rivals that develop (movement arrows, Developing column); Championships; fixtures; no-gi "belt is the ladder".
- Other menus in the agreed map (not in the seven; final text per MENU_STRUCTURE_S402): Start (three starts, already in game); First week; Fighters (a real roster); Fights (Ask for a fight sits under
  the offers: level, date window, an answer with its reason; it waits for the bot test that a smart ask beats a plain one, R37); Fight prep ("What your plan should answer", no injury-risk lines on camp
  choices); Club > People (staff cards keep their faces; members panel cut); Grow (finding and signing only plus the pro offer; no prospect deadlines); Top bar (no change).
- Held back, do not build from an old mockup: one change after the Why, camp injury risk, scorecards after each round, members panel, prospect deadlines, sponsor line and per-fighter costs, the progress chart on History.
- Conditional elements and when each appears: Coach's pad nights (two fighters in camp, until a camp ends); Needs flag for the second camp (the second camp starts, until she opens the Week); Cutman card (an eye reaches
  the closing state at the bell); Adapted note (from round 2, when the opponent has answered one of your lines); Rival offer (the running world sends one; a flag only, answered or past its date); Ask for a fight
  (always, once a boxer is signed); Swing reason (a random roll moved a number you can see, scrolls off with the week).

## 7. The owner's standing rulings on screens (quoted or near-verbatim)

- Only actionable information: "i do not want stupid and unecessary information to be displayed unless the player can really do something about it". Cut it, hover it, or put the action on it.
- One top bar and modals; nothing opens by itself; moments come as flags on the top bar. A week review sits as a need on Home.
- No flavour text; plain words; one word per concept (Raw, Usable, Sharp, Signature everywhere). Hover explains every number.
- Not mobile: "thats not how sim/manager games look , its very simplestic no actual stats to make the player understand how good the fighter is". Real stats stay. Not an 80s spreadsheet; no placeholders.
- Do NOT judge against a generic management sim ("they seems like economic management simulator"). Judge fit to this game and its plan.
- Look B, the gym whiteboard: marker notes, polaroid, needs as sticky notes, the cash tin, the fight date circled; warm tan plaster wall, wood and aluminium frames, cream paper. ONE art style across menus
  ("no art consistency" was his complaint). Stylized comic portraits in menus are on and must match the fighter. Marker fonts Permanent Marker and Kalam.
- Screens come only from agreed mockups; nothing is built on a menu he has not OK'd. A generic Money page was reverted.
- Fight night goes dark and tight (the Miro "Corner minute"); the coach's notes stay handwritten.
- Everything new ships switched ON. Hover cards on top-bar date and cash. Animated meters (every bar tweens).
- Weekly job pages must not become a pop-up. One-click reach from anywhere. Two Point alignment is parked (the gym floor is out of the first release).
- No gym still with the Day Plan or a drawer open; stills of fights show both fighters head to feet; boxers wear boots (visual rules for pictures).
- Scouting means opponents; finding fighters is "Find a fighter". The facility is a "gym"; a fight camp is only pre-bout preparation. Fighters are fictional; organisations real-named only where legal.

## 8. Where the documents and the code differ, and what could not be established

Code wins. For the critic: do not judge a screen against these older statements.
- Autosave, Settings and Handbook: docs say "not built"; they are built (autosave every Monday).
- Pros have no offers/world after the debut (docs): the code has a pro ladder, promoter offers, asking, scouting, belts, ageing and retirement.
- Ask for a fight: docs say impossible; it exists for pros only. Amateurs cannot ask.
- Gym closes after 4 weeks below $0 (CLAUDE.md numbers) vs 8 weeks in code. Gym's share of a pro purse 35% (CLAUDE.md) vs 25% in code. A loss costs 3 members and 2 reputation (CLAUDE.md) vs 1 and 2 in code (stoppage 2 and 4).
- Ex-pro head-coach edge: design says one extra corner call; code gives one opponent tell on file at booking. Old hand: design "cheaper camps"; code: easier weight cuts.
- Roster limit "up to 8": code gives 3 places, +2 per premises tier, +1 per second coach (5 and 7 at the larger premises).
- Four rail buttons plus Playbook: the Playbook is reached from the fighter page, not the rail. Docs on Fights tabs are out of date (one page).
- "Coach runs it", year review and club goals, club tiers, rival gym, poaching, career clock: not in code. Overdraft has rules but no screen found. Keys 1-5 for the rail and highlights/full watch options: not found.
- NOT ESTABLISHED: the exact number of moves in the Playbook; whether the 3D corner's cutman choice offers "stop it / go on"; whether the week review ever opens without a press (the owner listed it as a defect on 2026-11-08);
  the owner's answer on an open-ended career and a roster of 8; whether R11 (readable reason for every swing) exists beyond the Why; crossover numbers between boxing and BJJ (left blank on purpose).

## Added S409
The building: chosen once at new career, one of four gym plans, each with one small permanent edge (5% more members, 5% more show income, 3% better power and technique training, or injured boxers back 10% sooner).
The gym on Home has people in it: the club's fighters and members, working at equipment and walking the floor. More members, more people (2 to 12). Decoration only: they take no clicks.

## Added S410
- The shell's top bar is dark on every game screen (5.0).
- Fighters > Roster (5.4) is now full-body cards on a painted gym: weight class and rank, a corner flag for the most urgent answer (Set camp, Offer, Weight, Mood low), Condition / Mood / Weight tiles, the next fight and days to it; a click opens the fighter's page. Under them, Scouted for you: up to four prospects, with Invite to a trial. A Cards / Table switch keeps the sortable table (Rank, The Road, Goal).
- Fights > a bout offer (5.6) opens as a versus screen: the two boxers on a red and a blue wall, the tale of the tape (record, age, weight on the day against the limit, height, stance), the win chance and how sure it is, what a win and a loss change, Full report / Pass / Accept. Full report is the old bout page: stats against the estimate, win band, ranks at stake, the file, the terms.
- The game does not hold a venue, last-five form or a fighter's reach, and there is no scouting before accepting an amateur offer.

## Added S448 (code check)
- The attributes in section 3 marked AGREED, NOT BUILT are in the code: `scripts/rules/Attrs.gd` holds the 14 abilities (Strength,
  Explosiveness, Speed, Stamina, Recovery, Flexibility, Durability, Fight IQ, Composure; skills Accuracy, Timing, Defence, Footwork,
  Inside fighting) plus Heart; the old seven (Power, Hand speed, Technique, Defence, Conditioning, Ring IQ, Chin) are kept as a summary
  read from them. Punches are moves with mastery. Our own fighters have no height or reach value yet (opponents do).
- The plan's step and defence answers are `StrikeMap` arrows: step in, step out, step back, cut off, herd, pivot out, push off, feint,
  tie up, roll out. They have no mastery today and always work in full.
- Coaches: Luke Reid pads 74 (rating 58), Marcus Hale pads 58 / conditioning 90 (rating 74).
- Units: the code counts a pad night as 240 drill units (PadWeek.PAD_NIGHT_MINUTES) for the 75 real minutes in 4.2; a sparring night shares 180
  units over the moves on the fighter's cards and plan. Mastery maths uses the units.

SANDBOX (S412): the player runs any gym with any boxers, men or women. Never write about one boxer as the story, and never a fixed he or she in text or mockups.

# What a critic can open (S403)

Operator: "giveaccess to miro board for the critics and everything else required". Read `ops/research/CRITIC_PACK.md` first, then use whatever here helps. All of it is read-only for a critic: change nothing.

## The Miro board
https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVEV03QWA=/ (the only board; never uXjVETf7la4=, it is archived).
Load the tools with ToolSearch, all in one call: `select:mcp__7308b134-feb7-4aa9-9a3c-39cae47ed6e1__canvas_read_as_svg,mcp__7308b134-feb7-4aa9-9a3c-39cae47ed6e1__canvas_search,mcp__7308b134-feb7-4aa9-9a3c-39cae47ed6e1__comment_list_comments,mcp__7308b134-feb7-4aa9-9a3c-39cae47ed6e1__image_get_data`
Read a frame with `canvas_read_as_svg`, `widget_ids: ["<id>"]`. The owner's notes are both yellow stickies and comments, so read comments too with `comment_list_comments`.

| Frame | Id | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| MENUS FINAL (S402) | 3458764689777613662 | 17 menus: layout, Ludo's painted art, the owner's stickies |
| PAINTED MENUS (S401) | 3458764689772257568 | Painted version of each menu |
| MENUS FOR YOUR OK (S401) | 3458764689771007533 | The earlier round, with the owner's notes |
| MECHANICS LIST (S401) | 3458764689772104154 | 103 candidate mechanics and the owner's notes |
| P0 Where we are | 3458764689579200297 | What is done, being worked on, and next |

Some frames carry earlier critics' scores. Ignore them and reach your own verdict: they are there for the owner, not for you.

## The real game and the plans
- Real screens as the game draws them today, 1920x1080: `E:/FightCamp/critic_pack/screens/*_real.png`. Open them with the file tool.
- Approved menu layouts: `docs/mockups/s402/` (HTML and PNG), painted concepts: `docs/mockups/concepts/S402_*`, and `docs/mockups/s401/` for menus not redone in S402.
- The owner's answers to every design question: `ops/AgentComms/questions.json`.
- Design documents: `docs/GAME_BIBLE.md`, `docs/PLAYER_PATH.md`, `docs/STRUCTURE_DESIGN_S395.md`. In `ops/research/S400_REVIEW/` only YARDSTICK, MENU_STRUCTURE_S402, MECHANICS_DECISION_S402 and PRIMARY_ATTRIBUTES_S403: the rest carries earlier critics' scores.
- All code: `scripts/` (screens in `scripts/ui/areas` and `scripts/ui/modals`, rules in `scripts/rules`, game state in `scripts/state`). Never open `GameState.gd` or `FightRealtime.gd`.
- Research memory: `python ops/Tools/prior_research.py <terms>` lists what was already studied, `ops/research/`.
- Comparison games read from their files: the memory notes on Corner King and Two Point Museum, and `ops/research/TWOPOINT_ALIGNMENT.md`.

## The eight MMA fighters
Every menu is filled with the same eight MMA fighters so the screens are ready before the MMA release: `docs/mockups/s403/roster_mma8.json`, rules in `docs/mockups/s403/MOCKUP_RULES.md`. Grey with a reason means not usable right now; full colour with the warning triangle means not built yet, drawn as it will work. Check a screen against the fighters who stress it most.

## How to judge a screen
Say which options it is missing, which ones are useless, and what each option changes in the game. Open images with the file tool only: never start an app or a window on the owner's monitors, and never run Godot.



# YOUR JOB (critic, S450): score one design map - COACHES: FIT, LOAD, GROWTH, TEMPER, BOND

You are a fresh critic. Above is the whole game (the critic pack) and how to see it. Below is the design map for COACHES: who trains whom becomes a weekly decision - each session row gets a FIT number that moves gains and
tiredness, each coach has a list of fighters, grows from the sessions he runs, has one temper that changes one thing, and builds a bond
with each fighter that changes how the corner's calls land on fight night.
Nothing of it is built. The office mockup that will host the Staff app: `docs/mockups/s449/office/office_a.png`. Judge it as a player of deep management sims (Football Manager, Motorsport Manager, Boxing Manager)
would. You have not seen earlier versions.

1. LOGIC CHECK first: does anything contradict the game in the pack or the code facts it quotes? Name any button, number or row the
   game could not act on at that moment, and any name used outside a header.
2. DEPTH, score 1 to 10: is who-trains-whom a real decision every week for four fighters and one or two assistants? Try
   to break it: is there an assignment that is always right, a temper nobody hires, a bond that never matters, a growth nobody notices?
   Does each piece change a number the player sees on the week or on fight night?
3. PLAY, score 1 to 10: would this make you eager to press Continue each week?
4. Which options are missing, which are useless, what would each change? Go through the menu table.
5. END with "To reach 10/10": the concrete list of changes to the MECHANICS (not the wording), most important first, specific enough
   to build. Then describe your 10/10 screen for it as a layout on a 1920x1080 screen, panel by panel.
Plain words. No praise. Score honestly: a 7 means you would defend it to the owner. Do not ask questions back.

# COACHFIT1 v1: coaches who fit, fill up, grow, have a temper and bond (S450)

Sources:
- His order, Q-S294-210 "Yes, that order": the fight week, the office computer, then coaches (fit, load, growth, personality, bond), then
  the contract tab.
- The S448 plan (OFFICE_BOOKING_S448.md section 4), read from Corner King's code. Their pairing score is real. Their cutman, matchup
  analyst, personality bonus and per-block assignment do NOTHING in code. Growth is ~75 sessions per hidden step. We take the idea and
  WIRE every piece.
- Built or approved that this map must not contradict:
  - PROGRESSION_MAP_S448 M6 (approved Q-211): pads rating sets every bar's speed; the second learning slot comes from an assistant with
    pads 65+; Signature work = clamp((pads - 55) / 20, 0.25, 1); the four-assistant market; growth +1 per 10 sessions to a ceiling.
  - The club's 8 pad nights a week (AGREED PADPOOL1).
  - Loyalty.gd (R58LOYAL1, built): loyalty and "known" (how well the coach knows the fighter, RPG 3).
  - The shout rule (Exchanges: coachability 0..100 -> a shout lands 0.7..1.0).
  - Coach areas (CoachAreas: pads, bag, conditioning, strength, sparring; `rating` = their average).
- The S412 coach design (COACH_DESIGN_S412.md): his book, his limit, the bond. Its "book" is folded in here as the coach's SCHOOL.
  Its bond steps are kept.
- Rules this map obeys: names only in headers; game words; one pulsing button a screen; every mechanic wired and shown; no "+5% training"
  perks.

## 1. The idea in one paragraph
Today a coach is one average number. After COACHFIT1, WHO trains WHOM is a weekly decision with a price on every row.
- A coach who fits a fighter (the right area, a temper that suits the fighter's mood, room on his list) makes the week count more and
  tire less.
- An overloaded coach makes it count less.
- A coach grows from the sessions he runs, so a cheap one who works with your fighters becomes good.
- A bond grows between a coach and a fighter. On fight night it is the difference between a corner call that lands and one that does not.
- Every number shows on the week board's session row, and every one moves gain, tiredness or the corner.

## 2. Pairing fit (the number on every session row)
Each session (pads, bag, conditioning, strength, sparring) a coach runs for a fighter has a FIT, 0 to 100 from 50. ESTIMATE, sized by
FITPROBE1 (section 9).

| Part | Points | Read from |
|---|---|---|
| His rating in that session's area | +14 at 75+, +7 at 60-74, 0 at 40-59, -12 under 40 | CoachAreas.rating_for |
| The session trains the fighter's weakest of the stats it moves | +8 | the fighter's stats |
| The fighter's mood x his temper (section 5) | -10 to +8 | morale, the coach's temper |
| His load (section 3) | 0 at or under his list, -6 at one over, -16 at two or more over | the week board |
| The bond (section 6) | Stranger -6, Working 0, Trusted +4, Corner +6 | bond step |

What it does (the only two levers, both already in the week's maths):
- GAIN: x0.90 at 0, x1.00 at 50, x1.10 at 100 (linear) on that session's gains.
- TIREDNESS: x1.10 at 0, x1.00 at 50, x0.94 at 100 on that session's fatigue.

Words on the row: TOP FIT (80+), GOOD (60-79), MIXED (40-59), RISKY (under 40). Hover shows each part with its points. That is the
whole explanation, no paragraph.

The head coach (the player) has a fit too. The player's areas come from the HeadCoach background, which is today's rule.

## 3. Load: each coach has a list
- Each assistant takes 2 fighters (+1 at a pads or sparring rating of 80+, the only way past 2). The head coach takes 3.
- The start (four fighters, the head coach plus one assistant) gives 5 places for 4 fighters. The BJJ fighter's mat coach is outside
  this list (BJJ has its own coach).
- Over the list: every fighter on that coach's list takes the load penalty (section 2), not just the last one added. The board shows
  the coach's list as "3 of 2". The fix is a hire, moving a fighter, or accepting it for a fight week.
- The club's 8 pad nights a week are unchanged (PADPOOL1). Load is about WHO runs a fighter's nights, not how many nights there are.

## 4. Growth you can see
- The progression map's rule (M6, RPG 11): +1 in an area per 10 sessions he runs there, up to that coach's ceiling (hidden only until
  the head coach has watched him for 4 weeks; then it is printed).
- Shown: each area bar on his card with a tick at the next point and "7 sessions to 66". The Monday review names a milestone that
  changes something: "6 pad sessions to 65: second learning slots".
- A coach's growth stays with that coach. Let him go and it goes with him (the market's "let go" rule).
- Coaches do not grow in an area they are not running. The choice of who runs what is also who you are growing.

## 5. Personality: four tempers, each changing ONE thing
Every coach has one temper, shown as a word on his card with its one effect. ESTIMATE, sized by FITPROBE1.

| Temper | The one thing it changes | Fit part (section 2) |
|---|---|---|
| Motivator | a fighter's mood after a loss: -12 becomes -8 | +8 with a fighter on low mood (under 40), 0 otherwise |
| Drill sergeant | his sessions' gains x1.05 and their fatigue x1.05 | -10 with a low-mood fighter, +4 with a high-discipline one (70+) |
| Technician | move learning on his pad nights x1.15 (MoveMastery gain) | +4 with a coachable fighter (70+), 0 otherwise |
| Old hand | the fighter recovers 1 more tiredness a rest day | +4 with a veteran (31+) or a fighter back from injury |

The two existing assistants get one each: the pads coach is a Technician and the conditioning coach is a Drill sergeant. The market's
two new assistants are a young Motivator (pads) and an Old hand (footwork, sparring).

## 6. Bond: coach and fighter
Four steps (from COACH_DESIGN_S412): Stranger, Working, Trusted, Corner. One bond per coach and fighter pair. It is NOT loyalty: loyalty
is to the club, bond is to the coach.

- BUILT by:
  - +1 per session together
  - +6 per bout he worked her corner
  - +10 for a loss survived together (the week after a loss, still together)
  - Thresholds 0 / 30 / 80 / 160 (ESTIMATE).
- LOST:
  - -2 a week apart
  - -20 when the player moves the fighter off his list mid-camp
  - a quarrel event (rare, the drill sergeant with a low-mood fighter)
- WHAT IT DOES, and where:
  - Fit (section 2): -6 / 0 / +4 / +6.
  - THE CORNER (fight night): when he works her corner, a shout lands at (the coachability rule) x (0.90 / 1.00 / 1.05 / 1.10) by bond
    step. "Heard" and "Half heard" already show it on the fight screen.
  - Mood: a Corner-step coach leaving costs the fighter -8 mood and -5 loyalty (Loyalty.apply cause "coach_left").
  - "Known" (RPG 3, Loyalty): the head coach's bond step IS the known level the loyalty band reads, so one number, not two.
- The first two weeks with a new coach are Stranger: the fit's -6 is the "slow start" COACH_DESIGN_S412 asked for, priced before the
  click.

## 7. His school (the S412 book, kept small)
Each assistant has a school of 5 to 8 nodes from MoveTree (MOVETREE1, built): the moves he teaches best.
- On a move in his school: learning x1.1 and Signature work at his full rate (M6).
- Outside it: learning x0.9, and he can hold the move (no fade) but not take it past Sharp.
- Schools:
  - the pads coach: Jab, Cross, Lead hook, Check hook, step_in, step_out
  - the conditioning coach: Body hook, tie_up, push_off, cut_off, herd
  - the market's footwork coach: step_back, pivot_out, roll_out, feint, step_out
  - the young pads coach: Jab, Cross, Uppercut, Lead hook, Body hook
- The learning-slot cards (SLOTS1) gain one reason: "In the pads coach's school: x1.1". Where a coach stops, it shows as a line on the
  fighter's move bar.

## 8. The decision a week (what the player does)
- MONDAY (the week board, the Staff app on the office computer): the list of who runs whom. Each row: fighter (portrait, class),
  coach, FIT word + number, load "2 of 2", bond step, and one action: Swap coach.
  - The swap shows its price before the click: the new fit, the bond reset to Stranger, what stops growing.
  - "The coach runs it" fills the best assignment (the C20 control, AGREED): pick by fit, never over load unless no choice, and say why.
- HIRE / LET GO (the Staff app): the market's cards (M6) now show temper, school, list size, growth line and wage. Hire is the one
  button. Let go costs a week's pay and every bond with that coach.
- FIGHT WEEK: who works the corner (the head coach, or the assistant with the best bond); the bond's corner number shows on the bout
  card ("the corner: Trusted, calls land x1.05").

## 9. Probes (before any rule freezes)
- FITPROBE1 (Goose/Qwen, measurement): 26-week careers through the career harness, four arms:
  - all fits held at 50 (today)
  - the fit as written
  - the best assignment every week (the coach runs it)
  - the worst every week
  - Bars:
    - best minus worst is worth 4 to 8 wins in 100 over a season
    - no single part of the fit is more than half of it
    - an overloaded single coach (4 fighters, one assistant) costs 2 to 5
    - a Motivator vs a Drill sergeant on a low-mood fighter differ by at least 2
- BONDPROBE1: the corner multiplier's worth in close fights (Stranger vs Corner) inside 2 to 4 wins in 100 on close bouts; the bond's
  build so a fighter reaches Trusted with one coach in about 12 weeks and Corner in about a season.
- The S412 bots still apply: loyal / rotate every block / rotate at the limit / one-week farm. It fails if one strategy beats the
  rest by more than 5 points across boxer types, or the farm beats loyal once costs count.

## 10. Every menu it appears on, and what each is wired to
| Menu | What it shows | Wired to |
|---|---|---|
| Week board (Training) | each session row: coach, FIT word, number on hover with its parts | CoachFit (new), PadWeek, WeekPlan |
| Office: Staff app (OFFICE screen 5) | each coach: areas with growth ticks, temper, school, list "2 of 2", wage; the who-runs-whom table with Swap; the market's cards with Hire | CoachFit, CoachGrowth (new), StaffRoles, the market data |
| Office: Desktop | the staff strip: list used, an overload in Needs you | OfficeDesk |
| Fighter page, Training | the fighter's coach, fit, bond step and its next threshold | CoachFit, Bond (new) |
| Fighter page, moves | where the coach stops (line on the bar), "in his school x1.1" | the school data, MoveTree |
| Learning-slot cards (SLOTS1) | the school reason | LearnSlots |
| Monday review | growth milestones; bond steps reached; an overload | CoachGrowth, Bond, WeekCoach |
| Bout card / fight week | who works the corner, the bond's corner number | Bond, AMATEURWEEK1 |
| Fight: shouts | Heard / Half heard (already there), now also by bond | Exchanges, Bond |
| Result page | "The corner: Trusted, 4 of 5 calls heard" | FightWhy, Bond |

## 11. Build order
1. FITPROBE1 + BONDPROBE1 (measurements, rules modelled inside the probe).
2. Pure rules with tests: CoachFit (fit and its two levers), CoachLoad, CoachGrowth (the M6 rule plus the visible ceiling), Temper,
   Bond, CoachSchool. Data: tempers and schools on the coaches.
3. Wiring: WeekPlan/PadWeek read the fit; the shout reads the bond; MoveMastery reads the school; Loyalty reads the head coach's bond.
4. Screens (one a task, Grok Dev): the week board rows, the Staff app (office screen 5), the fighter's Training strip.
5. Golden path: hire the young pads coach, assign two fighters, reach Working, swap one, see the fit and the bond move, a fight where
   the corner's bond shows on the shouts and the result.

## 12. Risks
- Too many numbers on a row: one word + one number, the parts only on hover.
- An optimal assignment found once and never touched: the bond's build and growth make the second season's best list different from
  the first. FITPROBE1 reports how often the best list changes in a season (target: at least 3 times).
- Coaches feel like perks: each temper changes one thing the fight or the week reads; no flat % on everything.

## 13. Open for him (taste and scope, after the critics)
- Four tempers: the right flavours, or would he name others?
- The bond lost when a coach leaves: right, or too harsh?
